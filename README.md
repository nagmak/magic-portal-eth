# Magic Portal (Solidity)

This Magic Portal project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. You'll need the environment variables for `TESTNET_STAGING_ALCHEMY_KEY` and `TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY` to start deploying to rinkeby testnet. The front-end for this project can be found at [here!](https://github.com/nagmak/magic-portal-ui "Magic Portal UI")
